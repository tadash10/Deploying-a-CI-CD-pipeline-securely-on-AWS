# Deploying-a-CI-CD-pipeline-securely-on-AWS


Deploying a CI/CD pipeline securely on AWS from the CLI involves several steps, including setting up your environment, configuring AWS services, and ensuring security best practices.

For this script, I'll provide a Python script that utilizes the AWS CLI to set up a CI/CD pipeline using AWS CodePipeline, AWS CodeBuild, and other necessary AWS resources. The script will handle the creation of resources like CodePipeline, CodeBuild projects, S3 buckets for artifacts, and IAM roles with appropriate policies.

Before running this script, ensure you have the AWS CLI installed and configured with the necessary permissions.
